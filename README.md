# QPMS
QPMS is Question Paper Management System.
Students of graduate colleges frequently face the problem for preparing for exam pattern before exam week. They refer past exam question papers for exam preparation. At such times, to get question papers they have following options :
1.	They start contacting their Seniors (Most of whom who don't maintain or don't have it)
2.	They visit their Professor and trouble them (But in most cases that Professor may not be teaching same subject every year)
3.	They pay a visit to college Library.
But majority of students fail to get question papers by above means.
	In such cases, Question-Paper Manager System, QPMS, comes handy.
In QPMS, a student can logged-in and upload a picture of his/her question paper on his/her account. This picture will be visible to all juniors of that student from his/her college. So, any student who had given his exam on a particular day can upload picture of question paper on same day. Later on, when a junior will face the same subject in next year can use it as reference for studies. QPMS saves a lot of hassle faced by college students.
QPMS repository can be use by students of various kinds of colleges. Primary user audience of QPMS system will be undergrad students from both Engineering and Medical media.
Although we can achieve other alternatives for QPMS but QPMS will be much better than other methods. Because other alternative like uploading question papers common Google drive repository will  require collective efforts from both Seniors and Juniors.
Hence, QPMS system solves the problem of question paper maintenance.

I had use Bootstrap and PHP to develop QPMS. It contains free bootstrap template of Corlate from http://shapebootstrap.net for UI.
